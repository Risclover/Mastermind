## 1. Description
[Back to Top ^](#mastermind)

Mastermind is an old game that you may have seen variations of before (some of which have been called Mastermind, others of which were known as Codebreaker). 

In this game, the player must guess the 4- or 5-digit number correctly to win.

After each guess, the game lets the player know if any of the digits in their number was correct. The player uses this information to help guide them to the correct number.

The player only has 10 guesses. This means that, upon submitting the 10th guess, if the number isn't correct, the game is over.
